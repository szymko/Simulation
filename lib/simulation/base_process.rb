require 'thread'

module Simulation

  # Provides base for the process functionality.
  # Mainly deals with starting up a new thread for each
  # instance with BaseProcess#start.
  # Sends the methods to the thread via @in_queue,
  # the results can be obtained by calling @out_queue.pop.
  # 
  # It is important to note that the methods sent to the 
  # process may execute concurrently, but calling Queue#pop
  # will make the current process stop and wait for the result to come.
  # e.g. 

  # b = BaseProcess.new
  # b.in_queue << :long_executing_method; b.in_queue << [arg1, arg2, ...]
  # 
  # b.out_queue.pop
  # => waits for the long_executing_method to return
